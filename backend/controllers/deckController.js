// deckController.js
// This acts as a controller in an MVC structure.
// It handles HTTP requests (e.g., shuffling, dealing).
// It interacts with Deck.js to perform actions but doesnâ€™t manage deck state internally.
// This allows separation of concerns: API logic in the controller, and card/deck logic in models.
